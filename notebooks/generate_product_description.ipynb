    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) is an opensource framework used for developing applications powered by LLMs (Large Language Models). LangChain provides many libraries, APIs and templates to make it easy for us to develop applications powered by LLMs. LangChain [integrates with Bedrock](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/bedrock), and can be used to invoke the Bedrock APIs. **Note:** We will be using LangChain for 4 out of the 6 features in this workshop. \n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt is natural language text that describes the task that an LLM should perform. For example, you may prompt the LLM: *Describe microbiomes* or *What is the abstract of this text?*. You can use prompts to do various tasks with LLM such as Text Generation, Text Summarization, Sentiment Analysis, Classification etc. [Here](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/examples) are some additional prompting examples for later reference. \n",
